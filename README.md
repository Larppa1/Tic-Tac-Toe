# Tic Tac Toe
> *Do you have what it takes to beat AI in a basic game of Tic Tac Toe? (it's not that hard, really)*

Tic Tac Toe is a well-known game where you race against another player to get a certain amount of characters in a row. In this case, your opponent is the machine, and you
have to put enough X's in a row before the AI blocks you and wins.
